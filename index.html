                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Saying “we want a better website” is like saying, “we want a better business”. But what exactly does
                    “a better business” mean? Do you want to increase revenue? Maximize profitability? Or maybe improve
                    customer satisfaction? This could mean a number of different things for different people in
                    different situations. Unfortunately, simply wanting a better website is not a clear objective and
                    many professionals end up learning the hard way that solely stating so won’t correlate to business
                    results.</p>
